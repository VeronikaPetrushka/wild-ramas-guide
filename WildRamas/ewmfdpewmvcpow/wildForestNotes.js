        title: 'Footprints in the snow',
        forestNote: 'Footprints in the snow are stories written by paws and hooves. Each print is a story: where the beast was going, how fast it was moving, what it was interested in. Footprints can tell us who was here, even if the beast itself is no longer visible',
        citation: 'Tracks are not just imprints. They are words that the forest leaves for you. Learn to read them, and you will hear entire stories'

    {
        title: 'The Quietest Animals',
        forestNote: 'Some animals make almost no sounds. For example, the lynx — it moves so quietly that its steps are unheard even on crunching snow. This helps it remain unnoticed and sneak up on its prey. Silence is its weapon',
        citation: 'Sometimes silence speaks louder than words. Learn to listen to what is not spoken aloud'
    },
    {
        title: 'Why the Deer Freezes Instead of Running',
        forestNote: 'When a deer senses danger, it often freezes in place. This is not just fear — it’s a strategy. By freezing, the deer blends into its surroundings, becoming almost invisible to predators. Sometimes stillness is the best protection',
        citation: 'Sometimes it’s better to stop and look around than to run blindly. Silence and calm can be your allies'
    },
    {
        title: 'Birdsong at Dawn',
        forestNote: 'In the early morning, the forest fills with birdsong. These are not just beautiful sounds — they are a way of communication. Birds inform each other about their territory, seek partners, and warn of danger. The dawn chorus marks the start of a new day in the forest',
        citation: 'Every morning is a chance to start anew. Listen to the birdsong, and you will hear the forest awaken'
